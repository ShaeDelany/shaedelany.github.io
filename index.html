        <h3>Schedule</h3>
        <p>Lets take a look at some of their most important games this season against top ranked teams. Whether they won or lost, all of these matches had to most impact on their NPI. The NPI determines your ranking by examining wins, loses and strength of schedule. For instance, even though they lost to Emory in preseason, it didn't affect the Athenas ranking a lot since Emory is a strong team. Conversly, if the team were to lose to Pomona-Pitzer, their ranking would drop greatly since they aren't very good.</p>
